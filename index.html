        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello I am Ashley Cruz and I am a student at the University of California, Riverside. As of now I have yet to obtain work experience at my university since my first year has been a little hectic. When I started college I didnâ€™t want to jump into a job right away, but rather I wanted to test the rigor of the classes. However, I did attend a few organization/club meetings and workshops which helped me acquire significant information regarding my major and my future. During some of the workshops I attended later on, I learned how to apply for a job and the requirements necessary to do it. One of the workshops I attended helped me revise my first resume and cover letter which I wrote when I was applying for my first job as a student assistant in the History Department at UCR.<br><br>

        In highschool I had some experiences where I was a part of a couple of groups who aimed to help others. One of which was CSF also known as California State Federation. This was an organization that aimed at helping students prepare for college while strongly encouraging them to serve their community through volunteer work. I was in 9th grade when I joined the organization and I definitely benefited from the meetings and the tasks we were required to perform in order to continue being a member. The meetings informed me about college and I was provided with several resources to help me with some of the important factors like financial aid. I was also held accountable for selling at least one box of chocolate to help raise money for the organization and scholarships which were going to be given to seniors to help them pay for college. Through CSF I was given the opportunity to give back to others as I completed over 40 hours of community service.<br><br>

        Another experience I had was volunteering at the library for a whole year. I started in my senior year and took shifts every week since then. My tasks included: assisting students by checking books in or out, assigning computers, and printing material. Through volunteering I was able to learn some new skills as well develop ones I already had. I worked with a computer therefore I had to learn how to use the book system online. There were a few other students who worked with me therefore we had to work cooperatively in order to provide the best service to students and faculty. Besides the library, I was also in student council. In this club we raised money to cover the costs of the activities we were going to participate in when we became seniors. This club was primarily focused on cooperation and collaboration to generate the best outcomes. There were several times where things didnâ€™t work out as planned and when we disagreed with each other on the ideas for fundraisers. It was times like these where we realized that we had to be open-minded and hear each other out since we were all doing this together and we were the only ones who could give our entire class the activities we all wanted. These were all valuable experiences and I am definitely looking forward to getting involved at UCR.
